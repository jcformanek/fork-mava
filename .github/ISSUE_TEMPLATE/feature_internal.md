### Mandatory checklist before making a PR
* [ ] The success criteria laid down in “Definition of done” are met.
* [ ] Code is documented - docstrings for methods and classes, static types for arguments.
* [ ] Code is tested - unit, integration and/or functional tests are added.
* [ ] Documentation is updated - README, CONTRIBUTING, or other documentation.
* [ ] All functional tests are green.
* [ ] Link experiment/benchmarking after implementation (optional).

<!-- Base checklist. Don’t hesitate to adapt it to your use-case. -->

### Links / references / screenshots
<!-- For ex: link to CI job, experiment runs, etc. -->
